        <h2>What is Hydroponics Terrace Gardening?</h2>
        <p>
            Hydroponics is a revolutionary gardening technique that allows you to grow plants without soil. Instead, plants are grown in a nutrient-rich water solution, making it an efficient and sustainable way to cultivate a wide variety of crops right on your terrace.
